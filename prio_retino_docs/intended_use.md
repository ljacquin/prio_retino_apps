# Intended use

The Prio Retino+ software as a service (SaaS) is a deep-learning detection system meant to detect the following eye diseases :

* Referable diabetic retinopathy (i.e. more than mild) and its level of severity (i.e. moderate, severe or superior), and associated complications such as diabetic maculopathy, as defined by the international clinical diabetic retinopathy (ICDR) scale 

* Referable glaucoma (i.e. true glaucoma, pre-perimetric glaucoma, and high-risk suspects) as defined by the state-of-the-art (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32704418/)


The Prio Retino+ SaaS uses a fundus image as input in order to detect these eye diseases.
